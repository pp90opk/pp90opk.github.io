If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.\n\nFor the `password` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `username` and `password` parameters. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.\nThird-party developers do not have access to this grant type.\n\nFor the `refresh_token` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `refresh_token` parameter. The `scope` parameter can optionally be used to request a different set of scopes than were used in the original request, but it **cannot** contain any scopes that were not previously requested. If not specified, then `scope` will be set to whichever scopes were used for the original access token request. If trading in an old non-expiring access token for a refresh-enabled token, set the value of `refresh_token` to the access token value and `token_type_hint` must be set to `access_token`. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.\n\nThe `anonymous_user` grant type is a custom grant type created by NPR to suit our needs for functionality such as our &quot;try-before-you-buy&quot; experience. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to this grant type unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.\nFor this grant type, if you are a third-party developer, you are required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.\n\nThe `third_party` grant type is another custom grant type created by NPR to handle login via third-party providers such as Facebook and Google. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to this grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.\nFor this grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `service` and `token` parameters. If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.\n\nIf you are unsure of which grant type to select, assume that `authorization_code` is the one you want.\n\nNote that at this time, refresh tokens are an opt-in feature; however, in the future, they will gradually transition to being opt-out, and ultimately required for all clients. Our general guidance at this time is that if this endpoint starts returning refresh tokens for you, you are responsible for implementing the code to handle them appropriately in accordance with the OAuth 2.0 spec.
